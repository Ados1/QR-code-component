## My process

Step 1:
Set up your HTML structure
Create an HTML file and open it in your preferred text editor. Start by setting up the basic HTML structure.

Step 2:
Create a CSS file
Create a new CSS file named styles.css and link it to your HTML file. This is where I define the styles for my QR code component.

Step 3:
Customize and test
I then customize the styles of the QR code container and image by modifying the CSS.
Saved the files, opened the HTML file in a web browser using live server to guide me in my progress of work.

That's it! I built a QR code component using HTML5 and CSS3
